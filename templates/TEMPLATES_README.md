# THIS DIRECTORY EXPLAINED

This directory is used to store other template directories.
If you have any file structure you repeatedly use for starting a new project, 
you can save it in a directory in here. Then use 'upm template create <TEMPLATE_NAME>' to 
create your new project with the template.
