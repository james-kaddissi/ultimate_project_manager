# INFO ON LICENSES DIRECTORY

The purpose of this directory is to contain a copy of any default or custom licenses. Project creation will automatically use the default license if you have that preference set in upmconfig.toml. You can swap the default license by using 'upm config license <LICENSE_NAME>' as long as the LICENSE_NAME license exists in this directory. You can also save  a custom license, or a license not already saved in this directory using 'upm license save <LICENSE_NAME>' in the same directory as the license, if you want to save it under a different from the name given to the original use 'upm license save <LICENSE_NAME> <LICENSE_NEW_NAME>'. You can view all the licenses in this directory using 'upm list licenses'.
